## Summary

My skillset is a unique intersection between technology and education. I am a formally trained
educator with extensive experience teaching career technical education courses to adult learners, but
can also manage the teaching platforms to support the courses. I have designed stand-alone
courses, certificates, and degree programs both at the college level and in industry. As a Curriculum
Director, I managed issues around compliance, consistency, and quality control. I have performed
discovery with a wide variety of subject matter experts to assess their needs and help guide them
through the best course of action whether it be related to learning or business development.
Personally, as a maker, I have used Fusion 360 and am enthusiastic about Autodesk products.
